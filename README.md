# Parking
This project is for learning the basics of OOP and studying collections. 
The essence of the project: to create a parking model that has different platforms for different vehicles.
with a different number of seats. Each platform has its own rent.
I made it so, that depending on the vehicle, the program finds a place, get a ticket with information: site number, id vehicle.
After presenting the ticket, the program returns the car and issues a receipt with information: how long the car was in the parking lot, 
what is the rent and how much you need to pay. And the parking lot can again take the car to a new location.
